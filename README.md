# ðŸ”¥ Early Fire Detection ðŸ”¥

## Spot Fire, Preserve Nature! 
Effortlessly tell apart smoke from clouds using our smart fire detection technology. Our system is enhanced by a comprehensive database of more than 14,000 images and sophisticated machine learning algorithms, 
facilitating prompt identification of fire. Fast, intelligent, and vigilant â€“ we safeguard our environment against the initial threat signs.

The model was trained on the "smokedataset" by Jakub Szumny, from the Math and Computer Science Division at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. 
This dataset is accessible at [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/datasets/sagecontinuum/smokedataset).
