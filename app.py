    Conventional methods of fire detection, like manual observation and reporting, are often too slow, particularly in remote locations.
    Automated smoke detection systems provide a solution, leveraging deep learning for rapid and precise smoke detection in images.
    The skill to differentiate smoke from visually similar occurrences, such as clouds, is vital. This distinction leads to quicker identification of fire sources,
    allowing for faster response times and possibly preserving large tracts of natural and inhabited areas from devastation.
